# Matt Rodosky Module 1 Challenge, Planet Labs
## Overview and Origin
My company is Planet Labs
Incorporated in 2010
by Will Marshall, Robbie Schingler, and Matthew Roth
The company was founded in San Francisco with the idea of making satellite imagery more accesible and easier to use. Their goal was to create a small fleet of sattelites that were able to frequently provide high-resoluteion imagery of earth for use in GIS and other fields.
The company has been funded by companies most recently by Blackrock, Bloomberg, and Prelude Ventures, but in total have raised 573.9 million dollars from 35 companies.
## Business Activities
At it's base, the company aims to provide a more constant supply of sattelite imagery and spatial analysis that allows geographers to anaylze change. The company solves this by providing new images of the globe almost every 24 hours. Additionally, they use AI to solve the problem on how to categorize and analyze this data, while reserving humans with more knowledge to apply organized data to meaningful products.
   
Reliable and current sattelite imagery is an unbelievably important tool tons of customers, including governments,  NGOs, environmental organizations, agricultural companies, and more commercial ventures. All of which rely on sattelite imagery and geospatial information.
   
Planet Lab's main advantage over it's competitors is its very own relatively massive fleet that every day is taking brand new high resolution images of the entire earth. Their fleet is nearly unmatched in size and their imagery is able to revisit sites and and retake images every day, sometimes more frequently. Their AI integration is not the only one in the industry, but paired with their larger data set is able to provide a better and more effective product. Planet Labs also focuses on a broader range of applications, while many other companies focus on specific industricties.

Planet Labs Utilizes it's fleet of sattelites to take it's photos. Afterwards they use AI and machine learning algorithims to process and analyze the satellite imagery which can rapidly provide useful data.

## Landscape
Planet Labs is in the Geospatial Analytics field which includes lots of Data Science and providing satellite imagery, also making them apart of space travel.

Major advancements include the miniaturization of sattelites and the increase in their use. Barrier for entry in commercial sattelites has decreased over the last ten years. Additionally, the AI boom has allowed for rapid improvements in data and image analysis. 

Other companies include Maxar Technologies, Airbus Defence and Space, BlackSky Global, GeoIQ, and Remote Sensing Technologies.

## Results
Planet Labs has provided countless industries with higher quality and more frequent imaging allowing for countless industries to make more up to date and more frequent decisions.
    
As the biggest part of the game is quality and frequency of photos, Planet Labs has performed extremely well so far. Additionally, the accuracy and quality of their data is extremely good thanks to their analysis and use of AI
Planetbase is a privately company so their results are somewhat hard to track down, headlines about recent projects and signals indicate they are doing well. They are continuing to gather large amounts of funding when needed, up to tens of millions of dollars. Additionally they are continuoussly sending out more satellites to increase their ability to take high resolution images. Being reported today (august 15) they will launch it's first hyperspectral sattelite with spaceX

## Recommendations
One thing I would suggest is using their data in more specialized anayltics. Since they already offer such high resolution images and quality data, taking it one step further and using the data to monitor specific shifts happening in the world. One examply could be providing wildfire-danger levels to local angencies by monitoring weather and environmental factors in forests and protected land.

This additional service would extend the reach of the company. Instead of selling the data and images to other companies, they could bring this process in house and profit off of services that are now done by other companies.
AI would be instrumental in using this technology. AI would be able to rapidly organize the data needed to not only categorize what could turn into a wildfire, but also actively monitor the rapidly changing conditions in the environment.
Considering Planet Labs is able to capture so much new data throughout each day, AI and machine learning would be instrumental in identifying and noting the countless changes that happen between each new data set. The combination of the amount of factors that could lead to a fire and the quantity of data means AI is essential in the process.
